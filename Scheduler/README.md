# Introduction
This folder contains the *incremental* scheduling algorithms of TSSDN and all the datasets used for evaluating the performance of the scheduling algorithms. The offline scheduling algorithms mentioned in [TR](http://goo.gl/8HtZXo) will be integrated in due course. Currently, two scheduling algorithms are implemented for TSSDN, *Shortest Available Path* & *Mini-max*. Both these algorithms are implemented in the [file](SchedulingAlgos.py).

The datasets (different topologies and sets of flows) which we used for our evaluations are present in the [Datasets](Datasets) folder. We mainly used three topology models to create randomized graphs for our evaluations, i.e., Erdos-Renyii, Barabasi-Albert and Random Regular graphs. The repository also contains the scripts used to generate the datasets. Note that the values of the parameters need to be manually changed for generating new datasets. Each evaluation scenario contains a folder containing two files, links.dat and flows.dat. The file on [links](./Datasets/RRG/RRG-s10-h50-d3-f100-mp1-md1-seed0-c1/links.dat) describe the links in the topology as directed edges, while the file on [flows](/Datasets/RRG/RRG-s10-h50-d3-f100-mp1-md1-seed0-c1/flows.dat) specify the flows. Flows are specified as a tuple describing the source host, set of destination hosts and transmission period of the flow.

We have a file that executes the developed scheduling algorithms on the datasets.
